## Binary Numbers

### Unsigned Numbers

The bits present in the un-signed binary number holds the **magnitude** of a number.

```
# decimal = binary
108 = 1101100
```

### Signed Numbers

#### Sign-Magnitude Form

```
# decimal = binary
+108 = 01101100
-108 = 11101100
```

#### 1's Complement Form

Complement all the bits of signed binary number.

```
# decimal = binary
+108 = 01101100
-108 = 10010011
```

#### 2's Complement Form

add 1 to the 1's complement of signed binary number.

```
# decimal = binary
+108 = 01101100
-108 = 10010011 + 1 = 1001
```
