## Tell me about yourself (1-2 minutes)

**Start**: Hi! My name is Xiuyuan Wang and I'm a first year graduate student in UIUC with an expected graduation in the middle of 2023. My major is Information Mangement and my focus is software development, so I'm looking for Software Development Engineer Internship where I will be working with enthusiastic colleagues on solving different kinds of challenges and make some real impacts. I did several projects of web applications and socket transmission applications, and I have strong experiences with Django framework, HTML and CSS, MySQL database, and Python Socket module. I'm really excited to talk to you here because like Lacework, I always value the importance of openness, passion, and realness. Thank you!
